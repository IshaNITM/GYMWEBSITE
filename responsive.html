        <div class="tetra"><p>Food provides energy for physical activity.As you get more active and more fit,and/or as you lose weight, your energy needs(how many calories you need)may change.To get the energy you require,you need to get the proper amount off :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Protein, which is needed to maintain and rebuild tissues such as muscles.</li>
            <li>Carbohydrate,which is the boddy's preferred source of energy</li>
            <li>fat, which also provides energy.</li>
            <li>Water to replace water lost through activity.</li>
        </ul><p>Eating a diet that is varried,balanced,and moderate can provide you with all the nutrients the body needs without getting too much or too little of any one nutrient.
<ul>
    <dl><dt>Balance</dt><dd>means eating the recommended number of servings from each food group most days.</dd>
    <dt>Variety</dt><dd>Within each food group ensures that you will get all the nutrients you need, since no one food provides every nutrient.Eating a wide variety too much of any substance that may be harmful. </dd>
    <dt>Moderation</dt><dd>means eating a little of everything but nothing in excess.All foods can fit into a healthy diet if you eat everything in moderation.</dd>
    
</ul><div class="hepta"><p>Those who are very active or who are athletes may have special nutritional needs.They usually don't need more protein than other people,they do need more carbohyddrates(grains,vegetables,fruits)than the amount recommendes for the average person. </p>


    <p>Carbohydrate is stored as ready energy in the liver and muscles,and this supply is used up very quickly doing exercise.Endurance athletes(such as runners andd cylists)need a particularly large amount of carbohydrate.The carbohydrate needds to be eaten right before during exercise,because the body cannot store a lot of carbohydrate. </p>
